# Allow the Cloud Frontend to talk to us (CORS) - Defined via Render env vars later or handled globally.
# Note: For strict production CORS, we usually configure this in a @Configuration class, 
# but for this pilot, we can rely on our Controller's @CrossOrigin or add a property if we updated the java code to read it.
# (The user prompt suggested updating properties, but CrossOrigin is currently hardcoded in Controller. 
# We'll stick to the DB config changes requested which are critical).
